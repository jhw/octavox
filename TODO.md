- cli to take pattern arg and not iterate thru files
- remove command line pattern passed to cli

- gaussian temperature variables
  - sample selection

### long

- simplebeats
- SVSampler pull request

### thoughts

- slice ids ?
  - not enough similarity in patterns
- sunvox preroll ?
  - doesn't matter if going to do manual sampling
- render fx same way as trigs ?
  - controversial [notes]
- blender to preserve roots ?
  - no because no clones are created 
- "sticky" track/slices (heartbeat) ?
  - feels like overkill for now
- save colours ?
- harmonise fx/effects nomenclature ?
- sv drum levels ?
