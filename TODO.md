### short [02-mutate]

- randomising a cloned patches seed seems to affect the original version also

### medium

- mutation of machines
- cli density
- pattern breaks
- mutes
- chain action
- migration of slicebeats archives
- 3rd euclid arg

### thoughts

- separate sn/kk/ht patterns according to density?
  - not worth it

### done

- eliminate fixes
- randomise machines on per patch basis
- move euclid patterns into config
- simplify euclid patterns
- remove samples subdir from sequencers
- single sequencers list
- abstract sequencer yaml config
