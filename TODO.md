### short

- sample randomiser [renamed] belongs in /samplebeats
- better way of initialising randomiser with banks/curated/thresholds etc
- mutator to randomise mutes
- cli array dsl option
- arranger

### medium

### long

- caught_on_tape 808/909 sampes
- kk/sn/ht per channel echo
- vitling 303
- city dreams bass
- euclidian/bjorklund beats
- sunvox reverb chords
- noise hats
- librosa

### thoughts

- degrade ?
  - not sure it really fits 
- s&h volatility parameter ?
  - doesn't quite seem to fit here
- merge blender into mutator ?
  - blender hasn't really come up with anything good at this stage
- consider replacing keys with mutes ?
  - probably sub- optimal at this stage
- binary s&h ? 
  - think is too extreme
  - better to have a large range of mutator outputs
- center modules on grid center rather than output ?
  - probably not worth it now
- s3 utils for favourites ?
  - may require pico samples refactoring
  - feels like you shouldn't save and should keep everything ephemeral for now
- script to dump samples mapping ?
  - feels like overkill for now
- output format versioning  ?
  - feels like overkill for now
- ability to fix/specify certain samples ?
  - feels like overkill for now
- coloured modules ? 
  - overkill
- modules are overlapping ?
  - is a window boundary thing
- turn down svdrum samples ?
  - no; not worth it; just manually turn down SVDrum volume in UI
- pass keys to samples ?
  - no because sample keys are different from machine keys - oh/ch etc
- check why kick samples have id variation even at low temp
  - its the hat line not the kick line!
- blender script ?
  - not clear its useful
- validate trigs against module config ?
  - no one will ever use this apart from u so seems overkill
- echo wet on/off style ?
  - seems too explicit
- per- machine SVDrum/Sampler modules ?
  - probably overkill
  - would be useful for sv- level muting but that's really the OT's job
- initialise vitling generator with specific set of styles ? 
  - no because style info is part of machine
- mutes ?
  - don't think its consistent with cli options for different channels
- degrade ?
  - don't think it's really consistent with slices

### done

- mutator only accepts default profile
- replace randomisers dict with single randomiser
- mutator to load sample randomiser and generate random samples
- randomise samples
- add dsample variable
- expose mutator options as kwargs
- pass mutes to tracks
- tracks to store keys
