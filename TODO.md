### short

- use filestub not filename
- sunvox preroll

### medium

- arranger
- chainmaker / mutes
- reanimator date range
- SVSampler pull request
- breakbeats README

### octatrack

- re- practive recorder buffer workflow
  - parts rather than slider
- extended recorder buffers
- re- recording from master

### thoughts

- render fx same way as trigs ?
  - controversial as current way is pleasing
  - but 
- blender to preserve roots ?
  - no because no clones are created 
- "sticky" track/slices (heartbeat) ?
  - feels like overkill for now
- save colours ?
- harmonise fx/effects nomenclature ?
- sv drum levels ?
