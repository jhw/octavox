### thoughts

- remove equalisers ?
  - they are useful even if you don't use them
- rename s3 bucket ?
  - not worth it
- manually curate pico samples ?
  - not worth it
- improved colour flow ?
  - can't be bothered
- consider moving position of banks class ? 
- new "neighbour" grid manager ?
  - no current grid manager is fine
- remove randomise seed ?
  - no is useful
- stop inferring channel key from sampler mod name ?
  - seems okay as things are
- svdrum sample chain ?
  - very little added value
- `purge` option to remove samples unwanted by patterns ?
  - no it's over- optimisation
- remove custom pattern format ?
  - no it seems useful
- pico UI classifier gist ?
  - not clear it's better than the existing script
- use kick, snare etc key names ?
  - too much of a pain given samples use the same
- degrade ?
  - not sure it really fits 
- s&h volatility parameter ?
  - doesn't quite seem to fit here
- consider replacing keys with mutes ?
  - probably sub- optimal at this stage
- binary s&h ? 
  - think is too extreme
  - better to have a large range of mutator outputs
- s3 utils for favourites ?
  - may require pico samples refactoring
  - feels like you shouldn't save and should keep everything ephemeral for now
- output format versioning  ?
  - feels like overkill for now
- coloured modules ? 
  - overkill
- modules are overlapping ?
  - is a window boundary thing
- pass keys to samples ?
  - no because sample keys are different from machine keys - oh/ch etc
- validate trigs against module config ?
  - no one will ever use this apart from u so seems overkill
- initialise vitling generator with specific set of styles ? 
  - no because style info is part of machine
