### slicebeats - the good stuff :)

- it worked! sometimes it generates some genuinely interesting stuff
- the whole framework vs project boundary worked well
- echo sample and hold on wet/feedback is a revelation
- breakbeat slicing is clearly an interesting future direction
- inline sample slicing with pydub is something that hadn't been considered before

### slicebeats - the bad stuff :(

- tolerating separate oh/ch sounds feels like a mistake, precipitated by vitling acid banger 909 offbeats algo
- slices feels like a cul-de-sac in terms of adding modulation; feels like there is no further you can go
- slices modelling adds a good deal of complexity
- similarly relying on vitling beats feels like a cul-de-sac; no matter how good they are a) there are a limited number b) they hard- couple beats and volume c) the oh/ch thing introduces more hard coupling

### reflections

- single beat pattern per track
- base on euclid (large number) rather than vitling (small number)
- variation introduced by lfos and not via hard coupling (vitling volume) or hammer-cracking-nut (slices)
- possible lfos for sample selection, volume, filter application, hat release?
- introduction of non- sample models - svdrum bass/hats, noisehats, acidbass?

### still not solved

- decent basslines :(
- song modes
- integration with hardware gear
