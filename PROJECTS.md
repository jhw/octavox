### samplebass 

- find some pico bass sounds
- possibly normalise pitch
- create samples with different cutoffs
- vitling303 patterns
- random volume and possibly filter variation
- echo sample and hold
  
### synth bass

- analog generator 
- or city-dreams.sunvox
- vitling303 patterns
- filter cutoff and resonance variation
- slide and accent
- echo sample and hold

### samplepad

- some of these pad sounds are nice when they get accidentally inserted into the kk/sn/ht channels and have lfos applied to them
- what happens if you channel that thought, maybe slice and randomise, maybe shift pitch?
- what if you put a volume thing after echo and apply a stutter?
- what if you add a compressor and a bassline?

### nine09

- like pico|slicebeats but with native instruments
- kicker (and svdrum?)  for bass, noise for hats
- god knows what you do for snare but maybe resort to samples
- no slices; vary notes via controllers/parameters
- maybe vitling + euclid for patterns
- no separate hat sounds; use lfo to vary length etc

### euclid demo 

- take slicebeats as a base
- remove slice model probably
- replace vitling909 with euclid/bjorklund
- echo sample and hold

### sample chords / granular

- find some pico chord sounds
- slice them up and play longer versions
- how to apply envelope or lfo like tracker?
- volume and panning lfos
- echo sample and hold
  
### noise hats
  
- aphex twin vordhosbn
- open, closed, repeats, reversed
