### short [vitlingbeats]

- euclidbeats shows there's a way to simplify slicebeats 
- basically remove slices, store samples and pattern at sequencer level, and render tracks vertically rather than horizontally
- removes slices code, simplifies render code, simplifies config per channel patterns can be defined in code 
- along the way you might need to get rid of excess baggage such as fixes
- success might be simplification to the point at which you feel comfortable abstracting the code into the framework
- ultimately a patch might be just stringing together a load of machines and defining the cli to play with them
- maybe ultimately cli could be abstracted so it's just different machines each time?

### short [acidbass]

- narrow down acidbass parameter space via manual tests
- vca sustain on and release off
- resonance as high as you dare
- filter release in a very particular space
- filter freq can actually be in quite a wide ratio
- probably want to play with exp freq cutoff also
- and can you get the same effects with the separate filter?
