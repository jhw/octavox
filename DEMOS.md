### short [acidbass]

- narrow down acidbass parameter space via manual tests
- vca sustain on and release off
- resonance as high as you dare
- filter release in a very particular space
- filter freq can actually be in quite a wide ratio
- probably want to play with exp freq cutoff also
- and can you get the same effects with the separate filter?
